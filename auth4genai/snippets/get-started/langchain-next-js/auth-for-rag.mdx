### Prepare Next.js app

**Recommended**: To use a starter template, clone the [Auth0 AI samples](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ai-samples) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ai-samples.git
cd auth0-ai-samples/authenticate-users/langchain-next-js
```

### Install dependencies

In the root directory of your project, install the following dependencies:

- `@auth0/ai-langchain`: [Auth0 AI SDK for LangChain](https://github.com/auth0-lab/auth0-ai-js/tree/main/packages/ai-langchain) built for GenAI applications powered by LangChain.
- `@langchain/langgraph`: For building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
- `langchain`: The LangChain library.
- `@langchain/core`: Core LangChain dependencies.
- `@langchain/openai`: [OpenAI](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/openai) provider for LangChain.
- `zod`: TypeScript-first schema validation library.
- `langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough`: API passthrough for LangGraph.

```bash
npm install @auth0/ai-langchain@3 @langchain/core@0.3 @langchain/langgraph@0.3 @langchain/openai@0.6 langchain@0.3 langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough@0.1
```

import SetupFGAStore from "/snippets/get-started/common/setup-fga-store.mdx";

<SetupFGAStore />

### Secure the RAG Tool

After all this configuration, secure the RAG tool using Auth0 FGA and Auth0 AI SDK.

The starter application is already configured to handle documents and embeddings.

**Document Upload and Storage**

- You can upload documents through the UI (`src/app/documents/page.tsx`)
- Uploaded documents are processed by the API route (`src/app/api/documents/upload/route.ts`)
- APIs for uploading and retrieving documents are defined in (`src/lib/actions/documents.ts`).
- Database is defined in `src/lib/db`
- FGA helpers are defined in `src/lib/fga`
- Documents are stored as embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval (`src/lib/rag/embedding.ts`).

**Access Control with Auth0 FGA**

- When a document is uploaded, the app automatically creates [FGA tuples](https://docs.fga.dev/fga-concepts#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) to define which users can access which documents. A tuple signifies a user's relation to a given object. For example, the below tuple implies that all users can view the `<document name>` object.
- Navigate to the **Tuple Management** section to see the tuples being added. If you want to add a tuple manually for a document, click **+ Add Tuple**. Fill in the following information:
  - **User**: `user:*`
  - **Object**: select doc and add `<document name>` in the ID field
  - **Relation**: `viewer`

#### Create a RAG tool

Define a RAG tool that uses the `FGAFilter` to filter authorized data from the vector database.

```tsx src/lib/tools/context-docs.ts lines
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";
import { FGARetriever } from "@auth0/ai-langchain/RAG";

import { getVectorStore } from "@/lib/rag/embedding";

export const getContextDocumentsTool = tool(
  async ({ question }, config) => {
    const user = config?.configurable?._credentials?.user;

    if (!user) {
      return "There is no user logged in.";
    }

    const vectorStore = await getVectorStore();

    if (!vectorStore) {
      return "There is no vector store.";
    }

    const retriever = FGARetriever.create({
      retriever: vectorStore.asRetriever(),
      buildQuery: (doc) => ({
        user: `user:${user?.email}`,
        object: `doc:${doc.metadata.documentId}`,
        relation: "can_view",
      }),
    });

    // filter docs based on FGA authorization
    const documents = await retriever.invoke(question);
    return documents.map((doc) => doc.pageContent).join("\n\n");
  },
  {
    name: "get_context_documents",
    description:
      "Use the tool when user asks for documents or projects or anything that is stored in the knowledge base.",
    schema: z.object({
      question: z.string().describe("the users question"),
    }),
  }
);
```

#### Use the RAG tool from AI agent

Call the tool from your AI agent to get data from documents. First, update the `/src/app/api/chat/[..._path]/route.ts` file with the following code to pass the user credentials to your agent:

```ts src/app/api/chat/[..._path]/route.ts lines highlight={3,19}
import { initApiPassthrough } from "langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough";

import { getUser } from "@/lib/auth0";

export const { GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, runtime } =
  initApiPassthrough({
    apiUrl: process.env.LANGGRAPH_API_URL,
    baseRoute: "chat/",
    bodyParameters: async (req, body) => {
      if (
        req.nextUrl.pathname.endsWith("/runs/stream") &&
        req.method === "POST"
      ) {
        return {
          ...body,
          config: {
            configurable: {
              _credentials: {
                user: await getUser(),
              },
            },
          },
        };
      }

      return body;
    },
  });
```

Next, add the following code to `src/lib/auth0.ts`:

```tsx src/lib/auth0.ts lines highlight={2-5}
//... existing code
export const getUser = async () => {
  const session = await auth0.getSession();
  return session?.user;
};
```

Now, update the `/src/lib/agent.ts` file with the following code to add the tool to your agent:

```ts src/lib/agent.ts lines highlight={1,7}
import { getContextDocumentsTool } from "./tools/context-docs";

//... existing code

const tools = [
  //... existing tools
  getContextDocumentsTool,
];
//... existing code
```

### Test your application

Start the database and create required tables.

```bash
# start the postgres database
docker compose up -d
# create the database schema
npm run db:migrate
```

Start the application with `npm run all:dev`. Then, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
Upload a document from the documents tab and ask your AI Agent a question about the document! You should get a response with the relevant information. Now go to an incognito window and log in as a different user and try to ask the same question. You should not get a response. Now try sharing the document from the documents page to the second user and try again. You should see the information now.

That's it! You successfully integrated RAG protected by Auth0 FGA into your project.
