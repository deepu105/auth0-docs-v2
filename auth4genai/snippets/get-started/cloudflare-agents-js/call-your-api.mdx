### Start from our Cloudflare Agents template

Our [Auth0 Cloudflare Agents Starter Kit](https://github.com/auth0-lab/cloudflare-agents-starter) provides a starter project that includes the necessary dependencies and configuration to get you up and running quickly.

To create a new Cloudflare Agents project using the template, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-cloudflare@latest --template auth0-lab/cloudflare-agents-starter
```

### About the dependencies

The start kit is similar to the [Cloudflare Agents starter kit](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents-starter) but includes the following dependencies to integrate with Auth0 and Vercel AI:

- `hono`: [Hono](https://hono.dev/) Web Application framework.
- `@auth0/auth0-hono`: [Auth0 SDK](https://github.com/auth0-lab/auth0-hono) for the Hono web framework.
- `hono-agents`: [Hono Agents](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/packages/hono-agents) to add intelligent, stateful AI agents to your Hono app.
- `@auth0/auth0-cloudflare-agents-api`: [Auth0 Cloudflare Agents API SDK](https://github.com/auth0-lab/auth0-cloudflare-agents-api) to secure Cloudflare Agents using bearer tokens from Auth0.
- `@auth0/ai`: [Auth0 AI SDK](https://github.com/auth0-lab/auth0-ai-js) to provide base abstractions for authentication and authorization in AI applications.
- `@auth0/ai-vercel`: [Auth0 Vercel AI SDK](https://github.com/auth0-lab/auth0-ai-js/tree/main/packages/ai-vercel) to provide building blocks for using Auth for GenAI with the Vercel AI SDK.
- `@auth0/ai-cloudflare`: [Auth0 Cloudflare AI SDK](https://github.com/auth0-lab/auth0-ai-js/tree/main/packages/ai-cloudflare) to provide building blocks for using Auth for GenAI with the Cloudflare Agents API.

**You don't need to install these dependencies manually**; they are already included in the starter kit.

```bash
npm remove agents
npm install hono \
  @auth0/auth0-hono \
  hono-agents \
  @auth0/auth0-cloudflare-agents-api \
  @auth0/ai-cloudflare \
  @auth0/ai-vercel \
  @auth0/ai
```

### Setup environment variables

In the root directory of your project, copy the `.dev.vars.example` into `.dev.vars` file and configure the Auth0 and OpenAI variables.

### Define a tool to call your API

In this step, you'll create a Vercel AI tool to make the first-party API call to the Auth0 API. You will do the same for third-party APIs.

In this example, after taking in an Auth0 access token during user login, the Cloudflare Worker send to the token to the Cloudflare Agent using the Authorization header in every web request or websocket connection.

Since the Agent defined in the class Chat in `src/agent/chat.ts` uses the **AuthAgent** trait from the `@auth0/auth0-cloudflare-agents-api` it validates the signature of the token and that it matches the audience of the Agent.

The tool we are defining here uses the same access token to call Auth0's [`/userinfo`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication/user-profile/get-user-info) endpoint.

```tsx src/agent/tools.ts lines
const getUserInfoTool = tool({
  description: "Get information about the current logged in user.",
  parameters: z.object({}),
  execute: async () => {
    const { agent } = getCurrentAgent<Chat>();
    const tokenSet = agent?.getCredentials();
    if (!tokenSet) {
      return "There is no user logged in.";
    }

    const response = await fetch(
      `https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/userinfo`,
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${tokenSet.access_token}`,
        },
      }
    );

    if (response.ok) {
      return { result: await response.json() };
    }

    return "I couldn't verify your identity";
  },
});
```

Then in the `tools` export of the `src/agent/chat.ts` file, add the `getUserInfoTool` to the tools array:

```tsx src/agent/chat.ts lines
export const tools = {
  // Your other tools...
  getUserInfoTool,
};
```

### Test your application

To test the application, run `npm run start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` and interact with the AI agent. You can ask questions like `“who am I?”` to trigger the tool call and test whether it successfully retrieves information about the logged-in user.

```bash
User: who am I?
AI: It seems that there is no user currently logged in. If you need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!

User: who am I?
AI: You are Juan Martinez. Here are your details: - .........
```

That's it! You've successfully integrated first-party tool-calling into your project.
