### Set up an FGA Store

In the [Auth0 FGA dashboard](https://dashboard.fga.dev/):

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to **Settings**. In the **Authorized Clients** section, click **\+
    Create Client**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Give your client a name and mark all the client permissions that are
    required for your use case. For the quickstart you'll only need **Read and
    query**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Create**.
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/img/auth_for_rag_set_up_fga_store.png"
        alt="Set up FGA Store"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once your client is created, you'll see a modal containing Store ID, Client ID, and Client Secret. Add an `.env.local` file with the following content to the root directory of the project. Click **Continue** to see the `FGA_API_URL` and `FGA_API_AUDIENCE.`

The confirmation dialog will provide you with all the information that you need for your environment file.

```bash .env.local
# You can use any provider of your choice supported by Vercel AI
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>

# Auth0 FGA
FGA_STORE_ID=<your-fga-store-id>
FGA_CLIENT_ID=<your-fga-store-client-id>
FGA_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-fga-store-client-secret>
FGA_API_URL=https://api.xxx.fga.dev
FGA_API_AUDIENCE=https://api.xxx.fga.dev/
```

Next, navigate to **Model Explorer**. You'll need to update the model information with this:

```bash
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type doc
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define viewer: [user, user:*]
```

Remember to click **Save**.
