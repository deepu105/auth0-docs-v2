## Account Linking

If you're integrating with {props.connectionLabel || "any Identity Provider"}, but users in your app or agent can sign in using other methods (e.g., a username and password or another social provider), you'll need to link these identities into a single user account. Auth0 refers to this process as [Account Linking](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking).

**Account Linking** logic and handling will vary depending on your app or agent. You can find an example of how to implement it in a Next.js chatbot app [here](https://github.com/auth0-lab/market0/blob/main/app/api/auth/%5Bauth0%5D/route.ts#L43). If you have questions or are looking for best practices, [join our Discord](http://discord.gg/XbQpZSF2Ys) and ask in the `#auth0-for-gen-ai` channel.
